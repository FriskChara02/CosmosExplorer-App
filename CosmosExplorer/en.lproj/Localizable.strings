"secret_golden_pairs_content" = "These zodiac couples, once together, cannot be separated. Their love is gentle yet profound, and they bring each other great luck in both money and emotions. Let's explore these zodiac signs below!\n\n1. Pisces & Cancer:\n\nCancer is gentle and lovable, though a bit reserved, but still very endearing. They don’t like socializing but have good fate. Pisces blends strength and cuteness, is humorous, and enjoys life. Both value emotions and prefer a calm life, making their relationship very harmonious.\n\nCancer is sensitive and moody, but with Pisces, they become more settled. Pisces is perceptive and builds trust. Together, they offer comfort and emotional support.\n\nThis is considered a \"golden couple\" because their compatibility extends to work. With shared ideals, they achieve great success. Pisces’ intelligence and Cancer’s calmness create a perfect world for themselves.\n\n2. Pisces & Taurus:\n\nTaurus is mature, stable, but also demanding. They seek a loyal, kind, and caring partner. Pisces is gentle, nurturing, and mature in thought — a great match.\n\nTheir love is not fiery but harmonious and romantic. Taurus has high ideals and plans for the future even early in love.\n\nThey form a perfect family: Taurus earns, Pisces manages the home. Both are loyal and sincere, making their bond strong and beautiful.\n\n3. Libra & Aries:\n\nLibra appears elegant but is secretly playful. They treat friends and strangers very differently. In love, they tease and act silly. With Aries, it’s an explosive, spectacular match.\n\nLibra never refuses Aries’ requests, even supporting wild ideas. Both love fun, adventure, and taking risks.\n\nThey’re not just lovers but great partners. Aries’ ambition + Libra’s bold thinking = perfect synergy. They energize each other endlessly.\n\n4. Aries & Sagittarius:\n\nAries is free-spirited and hard to tame, but Sagittarius is one of the few who can. Sagittarius is strong, principled, and responsible, helping Aries mature.\n\nThough cool, Sagittarius is not dry — they joke, care, and inspire respect in Aries. Their love is gentle and deep.\n\nSagittarius supports Aries’ dreams and growth. In work, they help each other build a career. Their love is lasting, and they know how to please each other. Nothing seems to shake them.\n\nIn family life, conflicts are rare and resolved peacefully. Both are responsible and hardworking, making life better and more prosperous.";

"secret_quick_love_content" = "First impressions are crucial. Many couples fall in love at first sight, but once they truly know each other, they part ways. Here are zodiac pairs that love fast but don’t last long.\n\n1. Aries - Scorpio:\n\nThey fall in love instantly — Aries’ boldness meets Scorpio’s mystery. Passionate and romantic at first. But differences soon create barriers. Aries feels suffocated by Scorpio’s intensity. Scorpio values loyalty, but Aries’ actions seem disrespectful. They part when patience runs out.\n\n2. Taurus - Aquarius:\n\nOn the surface, they seem perfect: Taurus strong, Aquarius kind. But harmony leads to boredom. They can’t understand each other’s thoughts. Taurus is practical; when it fails, they move on. Aquarius is proud and won’t beg. Breakup is swift and clean.\n\n3. Gemini - Pisces:\n\nBoth curious and adventurous, they connect fast and bring excitement. But Gemini loves freedom and hates control. Pisces is emotional and serious in love. Once curiosity fades, cracks appear. Pisces realizes Gemini isn’t right for them.\n\n4. Cancer - Libra:\n\nCancer falls for Libra’s charm. Early days are sweet and romantic. But Libra has many social ties — love isn’t everything. Cancer needs security and can’t accept that. Misunderstandings grow, and the relationship ends.";

"secret_incompatible_content" = "These zodiac signs have such similar personalities that they click perfectly. Let’s learn more!\n\n1. Cancer & Scorpio:\n\nScorpio is hard to approach but lets Cancer in — they sense similarity. Both are quiet and reserved. Scorpio is cold, Cancer is calm — their life views align.\n\nDespite Scorpio’s moodiness, Cancer’s understanding softens them.

Capricorn prefers blue and yellow for luck.\n\n11. Aquarius: Yellow\n\nAquarius is dynamic. Rusty yellow feels restrictive and brings bad luck.\n\n12.
